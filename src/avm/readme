The Astro virtual machine
=========================

This is the official implementation of an Astro virtual machine, written in C.
Maintained by @bellrise, all changes that may break something need to be
reviewed beforehand.

It is designed to function on Linux and Windows systems, although the Linux
version may have less bugs and is generally faster. The project files are split
into 3 main sections: the src directory where all the .c files live, the
include/avm directory where all the headers live and the rest, like build
scripts or this readme.

When contributing, you must abide all these rules:

  - Keep the style the same as the code around you
  - Everything must be in English
  - Each source code file must contain the copyright header
  - Don't step on other people's toes - make your own branch
  - When changing something in an existing file, add your name to the header
  - Keep the same format of commit messages (`avm/subject: change`)

Code style rules can be found in src/main.c, in the top comment.
