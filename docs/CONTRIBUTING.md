socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation,
everyone should have a nice and harassment-free experience in this community.
Harrassing other people in this community will be punished.

## General Rules
- Keep the code you write the same as the code around you
- Everything committed in this repository is expected to be English
- Keep the same format of commit messages (See: [Commit Format](#Commit_Format))

## Commit Format
General information about the title and description, read this before committing.

### Title Format
The title should summarize everything cleary and understandable
in proper English, if your commit is not huge and needs a longer
title, the title shouldn't be longer than 50 characters in total.
But if your commit is too big for the information that can fit
in the title and description according to these rules, you should
consider splitting your absolute commit into smaller sub-commits.

### Description
The description should contain understandable and clear proper English
like the title. The description can definitely be longer than 50 characters
and is supposed to have compact information about what you're committing.
Make sure that it doesn't have any irrelevant or too elaborative information,
keep it simple and short.
